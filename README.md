Workload Automation Consultant with a strong background in product delivery. I specialize in designing and implementing automation solutions that optimize business processes, enhance operational efficiency, and ensure seamless IT operations. Skilled in analyzing requirements, identifying automation opportunities, data-driven decision-making
and delivering customized solutions, I thrive at the intersection of technology and business impact. 

Beyond automation, I’m deeply interested in product strategy and management, with a focus on SaaS and B2B solutions. My long term goal is to transition into Product Management, leveraging my technical expertise and problem-solving mindset to build scalable, user-centric products.

I also write about products, process, and policy on substack, exploring how technology shapes business and governance. I am always learning, always iterating—open to new opportunities and conversations.
